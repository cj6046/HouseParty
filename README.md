# Welcome to House Party!

House Party is a web application built using Django and React that communicates with the Spotify api. Host users will be able to create 'rooms' where they can host a party and play music from Spotify. Guest users will be able to join the room and vote to skip tracks or change playlists.

# The Process

This is my first experience with both Django and React. Needless to say, I am learning a ton! Thankfully, I do have experience with all of the languages involved so the learning curve really only includes the frameworks. By the end, I hope to not only have a working project to include on my resume, but also the knowledge to move forward and create other apps in the future.
