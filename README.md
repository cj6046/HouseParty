# Welcome to HouseParty!

This is a web application built using Django and React that communicates with the Spotify api. Users will be able to create 'rooms' where they can host a party and play music from Spotify. Guest users will be able to join the room and vote to skip tracks or change playlists.

# Learning

I am learning a lot through this project. This is my first time working with Django and React and I am very excited to be creating something I can use.
